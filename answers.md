2. Architecture
  
   * Explain how the CPU provides concurrency:

    The ability of a CPU to handle mutiple tasks at the same time is concurrency.  The CPU either sends various instructions to its components through the RAM, or has multiple cores.  In the latter case the various cores of processor can handle simultaneous instructions providing rapid concurrency.

   * Describe assembly language and machine language:

    Assembly language is a low level programming language that is compiled to machine language in order to be executed.  Machine language is direct instructions to the machine in the form of binary(or hex).

   * Suggest the role Graphics Cards play in Machine Learning:

    Graphics cards possess more processing power through the inclusion of additional cores, as compared to the CPU.   This allows more concurrence, and therefore the possibility of additional tasks is increased.
